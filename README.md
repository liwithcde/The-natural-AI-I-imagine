The natural AI I imagine

Sometimes I think the mainstream paradigm of AI is unnatural. In my imagination, there is an agent with parameters and neurons and links in, and an environment, in which the agent navigates. The agent polishes itself from **interacting with the environment** by updating its parameters **constantly** from the loss, and may even update the parameterized loss function itself, which may be called meta-learning.

AI engineers design the agent's sensory mechanisms, adjust the parameter space of its sensors, determine appropriate long-term and short-term memory storage, choose suitable information processing architectures, connect various layers, and more.

The pairs of the agent and its environment can take various forms, such as a model in a physics engine, a web crawler operating in a command-line tool connected to the internet, a physical robot navigating the real world, or even a highly theoretical mathematical explorer in a universe of exotic data structures, among others.

The knowledge learned by different engines may be represented and transferred in a form similar to embeddings.
